# syscall_tracer

Syscall tracer for IDA

## Purpose

This project was created to address the challenges faced when dealing with Direct Syscalls vs Indirect Syscalls. By using this syscall tracer, you can effectively trace and analyze system calls, making it easier to understand and debug the behavior of applications that use these syscalls. This project still has a lot mistakes, hope you guys can support me to make it better.

## Features
- Currently support for windows (static, dynamic)
## TODO
- Support linux (static, dynamic)
